# Malware Extraction Tool

This tool was created by Vit Karafiat, MSc as part of his master thesis:  
[Machine learning privacy: analysis and implementation of model extraction attacks](https://dspace.cvut.cz/handle/10467/95288) 

MET through its easy-to-use API and built-in attacks, datasets, and models, allows easy experimentation and testing of existing model extraction attacks.
It also has all the necessary building blocks for easy creation and prototyping of new attacks. The goal of MET is to make it easier to try state-of-the-art model
extraction attacks and compare them in different settings. We also try to provide the necessary building blocks to create new attacks. The tool can be used not only by
researchers that want to compare attacks under similar settings, but also by anyone that wishes to test their model and see how susceptible it is to model extraction
attacks. 

## TODO
- Add instructions and usage
- Add some implementation details
